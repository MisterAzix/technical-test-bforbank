# üöÄ BforBank Technical Test üöÄ

## Introduction

Welcome to the BforBank MoneyPot Microservice. This project is a part of the technical test for BforBank's internship program. The microservice is designed to manage a "MoneyPot" for each customer. Every time a customer makes a purchase, the merchant can add a certain amount to the customer's MoneyPot. The customer can check their MoneyPot at any time to see if it is available. A MoneyPot is considered available if the customer has made at least 3 purchases and has a minimum of ‚Ç¨10 in their MoneyPot.

The microservice is built using Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and Maven. It exposes a REST API for managing the MoneyPots.

## What could be improved ?
- Add rights management with a canExecute method at usecase level
- Add Deployment 
- Add environment management (to prepare deployment)
- Add E2E tests
- Add coverage check to prevent pull request to be merged if test coverage is not enough
- Add a small front to interact with the API
